# ML-paper-EJPA

This repository contains all materials for the paper and analyses in:

Fokkema, M., Iliescu, D., Greiff, S., & Ziegler, M. (in press). Machine learning and prediction in psychological assessment: Some promises and pittfalls. *European Journal of Psychological Assessment*.

The folder [Parameter tuning](/Parameter%20tuning) contains an R script for tuning the parameters of the models fitted in the main paper. It contains the R markdown file Tuning Parameters.Rmd, which can be run to recreate ESM (electronic supplementary material) file 5. The .Rda files in the folder contain the saved results for each model as .Rda files. Files apa.cls, paper.bib and data.csv are files needed to rerun the analyses and compile the R markdown document.

The folder [Paper](/Paper) contains an R markdown file Paper.Rmd, which can be run to recreate the main paper (Paper.docx). Also, it contains an R markdown file which can be run to recreate ESM file 3: Replication-paper.Rmd. The .Rda files in the folder contain saved models, to reduce computation times when compiling the R Markdown file. Furthermore the folder contains some .docx and .pdf and files that were used for submission; a file paper.bib, which contains the references; a file data.csv which is directly copied from folder RIASEC_data12Dec2018; files reference.docx and apa.csl which are needed to compile the R markdown file.

The folder [RIASEC_data12Dec2018](/RIASEC_data12Dec2018) contains the RIASEC data as downloaded from the Open Psychometrics Project (https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/). 

Additional folders are also included, but not very interesting.
